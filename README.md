# Matrix Reduction Project in DPHPC Course
## Suggestion From TA
- Add a dace graph
- Comparison  
— Use absolute values & bandwidth (instead of runtime)  
— Compute standard deviation  
— Quantum chemistry: 1000 -> 10000  
— Upgrade cuda to 11.4 (check)  
— Uninstall and reinstall JAX  
— Run maybe 1000 times  
— Different sizes for 1D reduction  
— Mention competitor version
- Add pseudo-code for algorithms  
- P7, illustrate the algorithms
- P18, use diagram to show the scheduler logic
- Mention why atomic is faster than non-atomic for 2D & 3D
- Mention limitations on implementing high-dimension reduction
