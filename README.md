## Matrix Reduction Project in DPHPC Course
- Directory 'library' is our final library and the scheduler. Reduce.py is for our scheduler, calling function 'Reduce' can do reduction. Other files are our algorithms for different dimensions. util.py defines warp reduction function in dace.  
- Directory 'tests' is our test script for comparing different algorithms and comparing our method with other libraries.  
- Directory 'original' has our history files when we first develop the algorithms and do preliminary tests. These files are useless now, but there are still some algorithms that are proved slow can only be found in this directory.
